# Creating a Responsive Portfolio Using Bootstrap

## Project:

This is a portfolio template with responsive design elements and systems using CSS in Bootstrap. Each webpage
will change to scale according to the screen it's on, from mobile to desktop. Images adjust in relation to their surroundings, text wraps around images, the navbar changes from a hamburger icon to an expanded navbar, and elements contained within the body of the page will adjust according to the space around them.
